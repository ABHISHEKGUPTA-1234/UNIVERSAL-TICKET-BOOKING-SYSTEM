# UNIVERSAL-TICKET-BOOKING-SYSTEM
A full-stack application that allows users to book various types of tickets — including movie tickets, concert tickets, and railway tickets — through a single unified platform. The system supports core features such as user authentication, event listings, real-time seat selection, payments, and PDF ticket generation. Additionally, it includes an admin dashboard for event management and booking analytics.

There are three roles: users, vendors, and admins.

Users are customers who browse events and purchase tickets through the application.
Vendors are event organizers who list their events on the platform to sell tickets.
Admin oversees the platform, managing users, vendors, and moderating events to ensure smooth operations.
Each booking results in an email confirmation sent to the user, with a downloadable PDF ticket (containing QR code). The system supports both basic and advanced functionality depending on the deployment mode (Normal, Hacker, Hacker++), and can be extended with AI-powered features like dynamic pricing and recommendation systems.
